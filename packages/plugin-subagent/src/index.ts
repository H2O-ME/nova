/**
 * `subagent` — isolated delegation, as an ORDINARY plugin.
 *
 * The tool it registers comes from core (`createSubagentTool`); what this module
 * owns is the wiring. That wiring used to be the HOST's business: the roster
 * called `subagentPlugin({ provider, tools, hooks, … })`, so the kernel knew this
 * package by name and had to be edited to change it. Now the plugin declares the
 * `execution-environment` service in `inject` and reads it, exactly like any
 * third-party package would — which is what "no special cases" means in code.
 *
 * Ships OFF (`advanced`): a fresh install has no delegation, and the operator
 * turns it on in 插件管理 (or writes its entry).
