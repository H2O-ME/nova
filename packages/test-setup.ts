/**
 * Test-run isolation: point `~/.nova` at a throwaway directory before any test
 * module loads.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — and why it is here rather than in each test:
 *
 * `novaHome()` resolves against `os.homedir()`, which follows `USERPROFILE` /
 * `HOME` at CALL time. Individual tests that remembered to swap those variables
 * were isolated; the ones that did not (five of them, including
 * `plugins/test/runtime.test.ts`, which builds a REAL kernel over a temp
 * workspace) wrote their session logs, spill caches and config into the
 * developer's actual `~/.nova/`. The result was hundreds of junk session files
 * in the real home — a test suite must never touch the operator's data, and a
 * rule every author has to REMEMBER is a rule that will be forgotten.
 *
 * So the isolation is installed ONCE, below every suite, and it is total: there
 * is no opt-in, no per-file helper to call, and no way to forget. A test that
 * genuinely needs a specific home still uses `withFakeHome`, which now merely
 * narrows the window further — it no longer has to be the thing that saves the
 * developer's data.
 *
 * DISPOSAL — green runs clean up after themselves; red runs leave the scene:
 * every test file (each setup-file invocation) used to leave its home behind
 * "for the OS temp reaper", and 76,000+ directories later that premise is dead
 * — Windows does not reap %TEMP%. A green run removes its own home (afterAll
 * below); a failing file's home SURVIVES, because a failed run's state is
 * exactly what a test author wants to inspect. Other `nova-*` temp families
 * created inside individual test files are reaped by `pnpm clean`
 * (scripts/clean-test-temp.mjs), which only touches directories older than a
 * few hours so a concurrent session's live run is never swept.
