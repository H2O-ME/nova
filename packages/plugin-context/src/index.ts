/**
 * The `context` plugin: it provides the context-insight capability and nothing
 * else.
 *
 * A plugin with no tools, no commands and no hooks is unusual here, so the
 * reason belongs in writing: reading a session's window is a WALK OVER THE WHOLE
 * LOG, and most sessions never ask for it. Making it a tier-gated provider is
 * what keeps that cost off the default install — the fold runs only when
 * something consumes the service, and the consumer is the web surface, which
 * renders the panel only when the service is there. So the presence of this
 * provider IS the on/off switch: there is no second flag, and no way for a
 * settings row and the data to disagree about whether the feature is on.
 *
 * It is `advanced` (off until a `plugins.entries` row enables it), declared in the
 * manifest below rather than described here — the same reason `subagent` and `ptc`
 * are: nothing a fresh install needs, and its absence costs a reader only a tab
 * that is not drawn.
