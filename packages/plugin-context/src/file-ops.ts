/**
 * What the run did to the workspace's files, read back out of the tool calls.
 *
 * Split from `fold.ts` because it answers a different question over the same
 * stream: the fold asks "what is in the window", this asks "what did it touch".
 * The two share only the log.
 *
 * The map from tool name to op is a TABLE because it is knowledge about the
 * tool set, not a rule the fold could derive: `read_file` names a file to read
 * and `search_files` names a directory to scan, and nothing in the log says so.
 * An unknown tool (a third-party one, `bash`, a PTC program) contributes no row
 * — the log carries no structured path for it, and a row invented from a
 * preview string would be a lie about which file was touched.
