/**
 * `ask_user_question` over a chat window: how a question is SHOWN.
 *
 * A chat window is not a form. The browser renders the batch as cards with real
 * controls; a peer gets text plus the options as BUTTONS, so this file is the
 * whole adaptation:
 *
 *  - `renderQuestions` numbers the options, because "the third one" has to be
 *    sayable and a label may be long or ambiguous;
 *  - `questionKeyboard` offers them as one-tap buttons (`/answer <n>` as a
 *    COMMAND button, so a tap and a typed number are the same message);
 *  - `layoutQuestions` is the numbering CONTRACT the answer side reads
 *    (`question-answer.ts`), which is why it lives with the renderer that
 *    promised those numbers to the peer.
 *
 * The other half — a reply becoming an answer — is `question-answer.ts`. They are
 * split because showing and answering change for different reasons: cards and
 * buttons evolve, while the mapping is where the feature goes silently wrong (an
 * answer that does not fit the questions asked is REJECTED by the broker, see
 * core's `validateQuestionAnswer`, leaving the run parked while the peer believes
 * they answered). Both halves are pure, so neither needs the orchestrator.
