/**
 * The QQ bot package: a standard plugin that owns its channel, plus the argv
 * surface for `nova qqbot`.
 *
 * The plugin half is what a host loads (by spec, from its own row): `plugin` /
 * `default` satisfy core's `Plugin` protocol, its `Config` validates the row's
 * settings, and its RPC namespace serves the settings page. The surface half is
 * only the claim-and-wait shape — it starts nothing, because the channel belongs
 * to the plugin's fiber.
 *
 * `default` is re-exported alongside `plugin` on purpose: the plugin tree unwraps
 * a spec-loaded module as `default ?? plugin`, and a module that offers both
 * cannot be loaded by one rule and rejected by the other.
