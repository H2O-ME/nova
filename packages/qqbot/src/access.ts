/**
 * Who may drive this machine over QQ, and how far.
 *
 * A chat channel is a PUBLIC input surface: anybody who can reach the robot can
 * type at it, and a group message reaches every member. The plugin protocol gives
 * a loaded row the same authority the host has — so without this file, every one
 * of those people could raise the permission tier, answer an approval meant for
 * somebody else, or simply ask the model to do things.
 *
 * Two facts are deliberately separate:
 *
 *  - **who** (a bound QQ identity, matched against `actorId` — the MEMBER in a
 *    group, never the group itself);
 *  - **how far** (a ceiling on the permission tier a peer may set for ITS OWN
 *    conversation, which stays below whatever the operator granted locally).
 *
 * ## Authorization is PERSISTENT, not a one-time ceremony
 *
 * This package's second deployment target is a headless server (`nova qqbot`,
 * no Web UI at all), and its first is a phone driving a desktop. Both are
 * long-lived relationships, so the binding is durable and the enrollment secret
 * is NOT consumed by use:
 *
 *  - an owner is written into the row's `owners` and keeps working forever, across
 *    restarts and reconnects, with no further ceremony;
 *  - the enrollment secret stays valid until the operator changes it, so a second
 *    device can be added later without re-enrolling the first;
 *  - with no secret configured, one is minted at startup and PRINTED ON THE
 *    CONSOLE — the only channel a GUI-less server has. Nothing here requires a
 *    settings page that a headless deployment does not have.
 *
 * The cost is stated rather than hidden: a live secret is a standing credential,
 * so it is only accepted in a PRIVATE chat (a group reply would publish it to
 * everyone there) and rotating it is a config edit.
