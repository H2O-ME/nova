/**
 * Which session each QQ conversation is driving, persisted.
 *
 * This is what makes the channel a long-lived RELATIONSHIP rather than a series
 * of unrelated questions, and both deployment targets depend on it:
 *
 *  - **a phone driving a desktop**: the chat is bound to the session the desktop
 *    is working in, so a message from the phone continues THAT conversation — the
 *    agent keeps its context and the desktop's transcript shows the phone's prompt
 *    (会话接力, "passing the baton"). A binding that lived only in memory would
 *    break the handoff on every restart.
 *  - **a headless server**: `nova qqbot` reboots, and the peer's conversation must
 *    survive it. Without this, every restart silently starts every chat over from
 *    an empty history — the opposite of the persistent experience this is for.
 *
 * The DUrable identity of a session is its LOG FILE, not the in-memory id: the id
 * is minted per process, while the file is what a resume reopens.
 *
 * Stored under `~/.nova/qqbot/` (runtime data, not operator settings) because a
 * binding is a fact the plugin learns, not a value the operator writes — the row's
 * `config` is for the latter, and putting this there would make every incoming
 * message a config write.
