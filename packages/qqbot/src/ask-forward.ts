/**
 * A pending ask's **push + fallback**: send it to QQ and arm a must-settle timer.
 *
 * Approvals and questions are different conversations with the human but the SAME
 * lifecycle, and that is why they share this file rather than each carrying a copy:
 *
 *  - the peer answers by sending a LATER message, so nothing here is awaited —
 *    this half only asks, and the answer arrives through `inbound`'s bypass;
 *  - a peer who never answers must still converge, so a timer settles it on their
 *    behalf. What "settle" means differs (an approval is DENIED, a question is
 *    CANCELLED), so the action is passed in rather than hard-coded — but the
 *    timing, the bookkeeping and the teardown are one implementation.
 *
 * A copy per ask kind is how one of them ends up without a fallback, which is
 * exactly the defect this shape prevents: an ask that waits forever parks the whole
 * run, and a QQ peer can always walk away mid-task.
