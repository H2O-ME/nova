/**
 * `{env:NAME}` reference expansion for the loaded config document.
 *
 * Split from `config.ts` (which owns the schema and the loader) because the rule
 * here is about OWNERSHIP, not parsing: whether an unresolved reference is a
 * fatal load error or a diagnostic depends on WHO owns the value, and that is a
 * different question from "is this config well-formed".
 *
 * ## Ownership is structural now
 *
 * The product reads a fixed set of top-level sections; an unresolved reference
 * there is not a diagnostic — it is a process about to behave as if the value
 * were missing, so it fails loudly at load and names the variable.
 *
 * Everything inside `plugins.entries[].config` belongs to the plugin whose row
 * it is, and a plugin is only started by the invocations that ask for it. Failing
 * the whole load there meant an unset `{env:QQ_SECRET}` blocked the browser UI,
 * the REPL and `exec` — surfaces that never read that value — which is a plugin
 * taking the whole product down with it.
 *
 * This used to be a hand-kept ALLOWLIST of top-level section names
 * (`PLUGIN_OWNED_SECTIONS = new Set(['qqbot'])`), which had the defect the whole
 * refactor exists to remove: giving a plugin its own config section meant editing
 * the host. Now the boundary is the ROW — a plugin's settings live in its own
 * entry, so "is this reference a plugin's problem?" is answered by where it sits,
 * and a new plugin needs no edit here.
 *
 * Leaving the literal is deliberate over substituting an empty string: the
 * empty-string fallback was the documented footgun (an empty credential reached
 * the network and came back as a bare 401 with no clue why). A literal that a
 * consumer might try to use is self-describing, and the owning plugin refuses it
 * before any request goes out.
