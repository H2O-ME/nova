/**
 * Session-state tools must DECLARE themselves as such (`ownsSessionState`).
 *
 * The marker is what lets a nested ephemeral run (a subagent) exclude them by
 * flag instead of by name: a subagent has no board of its own, so a state tool
 * let through either writes the PARENT's state (emit inherited) or silently
 * pretends success (emit absent). The declaration is the tool's own duty —
 * `nestedToolset` never hard-codes names — so it is pinned here per tool: a
 * state tool that drops the marker re-opens the pollution path with no test
 * noticing.
