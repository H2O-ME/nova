/**
 * Contract group 2 — PLUGIN DISCOVERY (`buildTree`), and group 5 — the boot
 * graph's `page` flag.
 *
 * Discovery is the step that decides which rows EXIST, and two of its rules are
 * promises the rest of the product leans on:
 *
 *  - **load order** is a contract, not an accident: capability providers head the
 *    tree (a consumer activated before its provider finds the service absent),
 *    then the in-process built-ins, then what the surface contributed, then the
 *    spec-loaded rows (shipped packages before the operator's own entries);
 *  - **a row that cannot be imported is a ROW, not a crash**: an unresolved spec
 *    becomes a visible row carrying `error`, so a typo'd `plugins.entries` line
 *    still boots the kernel and still says what is wrong. The same test pins the
 *    mirror side — nothing is thrown out of assembly.
 *
 * Group 5 is one line of projection with a long reach: `page: true` on the roster
 * is what draws a settings section, so it must come from the plugin's OWN
 * manifest and from nowhere else — a host-invented page would put a section in
 * the navigation that nobody answers.
 *
 * The last group turns to the roster PROJECTION itself (`describePlugins`) and to
 * the manifest a third-party JS plugin really writes: a declared manifest is
 * copied through VERBATIM, so none of its fields can be assumed present.
