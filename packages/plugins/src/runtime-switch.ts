/**
 * The settings panel's switches: flipping one plugin ROW or one skill.
 *
 * Split from `runtime-roster.ts` (what LOADS) because this is what the panel
 * CHANGES, and the readers differ — the router calls these, the boot path never
 * does. One module, one discipline: **persist first, then reload, then verify**.
 * A successful call means the durable plugin tree and the live kernel agree. A
 * throw from the WRITE means neither moved. A throw from the VERIFY means both
 * DID move — the operator's intent is durable (the row stays written with its
 * load failure, which the panel reports) and only the flip is reported as
 * failed; re-enabling a row whose module cannot load is the case that lands
 * here.
 *
 * There is no per-tier list routing any more. A row is switched by writing ITS
 * entry (`{ id, enabled }`), which is the same field the boot path reads — so a
 * flip cannot disagree with a restart, and there is no second door that could
 * put a switched-off plugin back.
