/**
 * The kernel's model control (see core's `kernel/model.ts` for the shapes).
 *
 * Two authorities meet here and neither is duplicated:
 *
 *  - **The endpoint owns the ids.** `ChatProvider.listModels()` is the catalog
 *    (`GET /models` on an OpenAI-compatible gateway), so a deployment that adds
 *    or retires a model changes what the picker offers with no release here.
 *  - **The surface owns the metadata.** Display names and context windows come
 *    from the `ModelCatalogPort` the assembly was handed (the cli's models.dev
 *    store), because an endpoint reports ids and nothing else.
 *
 * The switch itself is in-place on the one client instance every consumer
 * already holds (`ChatProvider.setModel`), so nothing is rebuilt: the session
 * handles, the roster's subagent tool and the cache-affinity binding all keep
 * pointing at the same live client, and only the model id moves. The session
 * then ANNOUNCES the change on the kernel event stream, which is what makes a
 * switch made in one surface visible in the others.
