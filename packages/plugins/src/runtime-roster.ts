/**
 * The roster: turn the desired plugin tree into loaded plugins.
 *
 * The heavy lifting lives elsewhere on purpose:
 *
 *  - `plugin-tree.ts` decides WHICH rows exist and whether each one is on,
 *    from the plugins' own manifests plus the operator's `plugins.entries`;
 *  - core's `PluginLoader` owns activation, diffing and teardown.
 *
 * What is left here is the one thing neither of them can know: how to build the
 * in-process plugins for THIS kernel (their options are bound to live kernel
 * facts), and which of them must be rebuilt when the workspace changes.
 *
 * ## Why the candidates are cached
 *
 * The loader diffs by PLUGIN IDENTITY: same object + same config = same
 * activation, so the fiber is kept. Rebuilding the built-in plugins on every
 * roster would therefore replace every row on every workspace switch — exactly
 * the rebuild-everything behaviour the entry tree exists to end. So the
 * in-process objects are built ONCE per kernel and cached on the environment;
 * their options read live state through thunks (`rootDir`, the skill list, the
 * goal reader) precisely so that caching them is correct.
