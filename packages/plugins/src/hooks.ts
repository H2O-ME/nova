/**
 * Hook composition, on top of the container's typed events.
 *
 * The three lifecycle points are ordinary container events now
 * (`beforeLlmCall` / `beforeToolCall` / `afterToolResult`), so a plugin hooks
 * in with the same `ctx.on(...)` it uses for anything else, and unloading takes
 * the hook back automatically. What remains here is the *composition*: turning
 * the event chains into the single `AgentHooks` object the loop consumes, plus
 * the tool-set guard that must survive any chain.
 *
 *  - `beforeLLMCall` is a waterfall: a hook that wraps the request calls
 *    `next()`, one that merely transforms it calls `next(rewritten)`.
 *  - `beforeToolCall` is serial and first-decisive-wins, with the approval
 *    gate registered at high priority (see `permission-gate.ts`) so
 *    permission is settled before any other hook sees the call. The call's
 *    `ToolCallScope` is forwarded verbatim, because the gate decides with the
 *    engine of the session that issued the call.
 *  - `afterToolResult` is a waterfall over the result text.
