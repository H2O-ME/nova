/**
 * The built-in CANDIDATES for one host build: every first-party plugin this
 * kernel could load, with the config expansion done exactly once.
 *
 * Split from `runtime-roster.ts` because the two answer different questions.
 * This module answers "how are `BuiltinOptions` derived from config + live
 * state"; the roster answers "which rows are in force" (from the plugins' own
 * manifests) and hands them to the loader.
 *
 * The optional PACKAGES (subagent / context / ptc / qqbot) are NOT here: they
 * live in their own packages and load by specifier (`plugin-tree.ts`), so this
 * file is the in-process base tree and nothing in it needs a module that could
 * be absent.
 *
 * ## Row config
 *
 * A built-in's settings come from ITS entry in `plugins.entries` (`config`), not
 * from a kernel-shaped field: the kernel does not know that bash has a timeout.
 * Only the two built-ins that actually take settings read one here, and the
 * roster rebuilds this list only when one of those settings CHANGES — otherwise
 * the loader would see new plugin objects on every roster and reload every row.

/**
 * Every built-in plugin this build could load, in load order.
 *
 * ## No cache key, and no list of names
 *
 * The in-process plugins are built ONCE and reused for the kernel's lifetime.
 * They used to be rebuilt whenever a fingerprint of a hand-kept list of
 * "configurable" plugin names changed (`CONFIGURED_BUILTINS`) — because each
 * configurable builtin received its settings as constructor arguments. That put
 * a list of plugin names in host code whose only job was to know when to
 * rebuild, and it made "add a configurable setting" a host change.
 *
 * Settings now reach the plugin the way they reach a third-party one: through
 * the row's own `config`, validated by the plugin's own `Config` schema and
 * handed to `apply(ctx, config)`. The loader already diffs on config, so an
 * edited setting re-runs exactly that row's body and nothing else — no
 * fingerprint, no name list, and a stable plugin object per row (which is what
 * keeps a workspace switch from replacing every row).
 *
 * `BuiltinOptions` derivation still lives here and nowhere else: kernel facts
 * are always supplied so the base tree is unconditional, and "may this row run"
 * is decided in ONE place (`plugin-tree.ts`, from the plugin's own manifest and
 * the operator's entry) — two answerers would drift.
 * @param env - the live environment.
 * @param opts - the assembly options.
 * @returns the built-in plugins, ready for the loader.
