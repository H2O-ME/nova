/**
 * The surface registry: the live home of `AgentSurface` plugins. The cli reads
 * `~/.nova/config.json` `surfaces` (module specs), `loadSurfacePlugins`
 * dynamically imports each, and a registry built with `createSurfaceRegistry`
 * resolves which one claims an invocation — so a surface is a config row, not a
 * hardcoded entry.
 *
 * Mirrors the kernel-plugin tree's discipline (one spec-resolution rule, loud
 * failure on a missing export) so surface and plugin loading agree on what a
 * config string means.
 *
 * The `surfaces` capability ServiceKey: the registry INSTANCE is built by the
 * caller and must exist before the kernel does (the kernel is assembled after
 * surfaces load, and the roster needs the same instance to register each
 * surface as an ordinary plugin row). The assembly provides it INTO the
 * container (`surfaceRegistryProvider` in `services.ts`), and `surfacePlugin`
 * below is the row that consumes it — so a configured surface shows up in
 * `/plugins`, sits in the tier table and can be switched like any plugin.

 * Whether a loaded surface's ROW is on — asked by the shell BEFORE it registers

 * Resolution happens before any kernel exists, so whatever sits in the registry
 * CLAIMS the invocation. A row the operator closed must therefore stay out of
 * it, or the closed surface keeps winning `resolve()` and running `start()` on
 * every restart — the switch would decide only what the panel showed, never what
 * ran. The row itself must survive: `SurfaceRows.loaded` still carries it, so
 * the roster draws its panel row and the operator can switch it back on.
 *
 * The answer comes from the ONE enabled rule (`core`'s `rowEnabled`) applied to
 * the very row the roster will build (`surfacePlugin`) and the operator's
 * `plugins.entries` row for `surface.name` — the id the roster uses and the id
 * the panel writes. Override lookup matches `buildTree`'s own map (the last row
 * for an id wins): a hand-edited duplicate must not give the two readers
 * different answers. A surface row declares no manifest, so it takes the
 * `standard` default.
 * @param surface - the loaded surface.
 * @param registry - the registry instance its row registers onto.
 * @param entries - the operator's `plugins.entries`, in document order.
 * @returns whether the surface may claim (and be registered for) this run.
