/**
 * The kernel's own slash commands — the `commands` capability seam's first
 * producer (core declares `CommandRegistry`; nothing registered into it until
 * now, so every surface had to invent its own catalog).
 *
 * What belongs here: commands a kernel can run **on itself**, with no surface's
 * help — `/compact` is the model case (it summarizes the live session; the
 * compaction lifecycle then rides the event stream, so the surface only has to
 * render rows it already knows). What does not: anything that needs a surface
 * affordance (`/theme` needs a renderer, `/exit` needs a process, `/model`
 * needs the picker) — those stay with their surface, and a surface may offer
 * them beside this catalog without a second registry.
 *
 * Registration goes through `registerCommand` (the public plugin API a third
 * party would use), which ties the entry to this plugin's fiber — so a
 * re-roster unregisters cleanly.
