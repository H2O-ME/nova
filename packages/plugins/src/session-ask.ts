 * HOW one is opened. The split is also the point of the design — everything here
 * is PER SESSION, and the one thing that is not (the approval policy) is passed

/**
 * The ask wiring for ONE session.
 *
 * Per SESSION, not per kernel, because one kernel drives several conversations
 * at once (a bot channel keeps one per peer, the browser keeps one per open
 * handle, and a switch leaves the previous run going). A kernel-wide engine made
 * three conversational facts global:
 *
 *  - the TIER (`read-only` / `auto-edit` / `full`): a chat peer raising its own
 *    tier raised everyone's, up to and including the desktop's;
 *  - the REMEMBERED "always allow" grants: approving `git status` in one
 *    conversation silently approved it in every other;
 *  - the ASK's publish slot: `ApprovalBroker.attach` holds ONE publisher, so
 *    whoever created the newest session stole every outstanding ask's card —
 *    session A parked on an approval that only B's surface could see or answer.
 *
 * `audit` is a parameter rather than a container read because it must append to
 * THIS session's log: resolving the target through `current()` at write time
 * recorded an approval taken in A in whichever conversation was current later.
