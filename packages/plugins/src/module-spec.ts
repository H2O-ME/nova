/**
 * Where a plugin module IS: the ONE resolution rule for `plugins.entries` rows,
 * the configured `surfaces` rows and the extension table.
 *
 * A config row is a module specifier, and it means one of three things:
 *
 *  - **a path** (absolute, or starting with `.`): resolved against the working
 *    directory — the operator wrote the row while standing in a workspace, and
 *    a local file is the zero-install way to try a plugin.
 *  - **a bare package name the product itself can resolve**: handed to Node
 *    untouched, or — when only the host application can resolve it — turned into
 *    the file it resolved to. That covers the bundled extensions and anything
 *    installed next to the product.
 *  - **a bare package name that only exists in the USER PLUGIN ROOT**
 *    (`~/.nova/plugins/`): resolved from there, because that is the one tree a
 *    user can install into (`nova plugin add`, or `pnpm add` in that directory)
 *    without reaching into wherever the product was installed.
 *
 * The user root is a **fallback, never a shadow**: a name the product can
 * already resolve keeps resolving where it did. A shadowing root would let a
 * stale copy the operator installed months ago silently replace a bundled
 * package the moment nova is upgraded — the bug would surface as "the upgrade
 * did nothing", far from its cause.
 *
 * ## What "the product" is anchored at
 *
 * `appModulesUrl` is the HOST APPLICATION's own module URL (`cli` passes its
 * `import.meta.url` at kernel assembly), and it has to come from the caller: the
 * product's packages are siblings of the EXECUTABLE, not of this library (the QQ
 * channel package ships with `cli`), so a library-level anchor cannot see them —
 * a config row naming one could never load, while `nova qqbot` tells the
 * operator to write exactly that row. This package's tree is consulted FIRST
 * (its answer is the bare spec, which Node resolves identically at import time);
 * the app's tree second, and ITS answer is the resolved file, because a bare
 * spec would be re-resolved from here at import time and fail. No anchor means
 * library-level, exactly as before (embedded kernels and kernel tests).
 *
 * Entry resolution inside the user root is Node's own (`createRequire` anchored
 * at the root's `package.json`), so `exports` / `module` / `main` are honored
 * rather than re-implemented. The plugin convention is
 * `exports: { ".": { types, default } }`; a package whose export map offers
 * only an `import` arm cannot be named by the CJS resolver, and the bare spec is
 * returned instead — the resulting boot error names the config row.
