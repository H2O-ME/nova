/**
 * The durable goal: a completion objective the session keeps working toward
 * across runs.
 *
 * Three disciplines, each inherited from a mechanism that already exists here:
 *
 *  1. **Whole-value snapshots, log-only.** The tool writes one `goal/change`
 *     session event carrying the COMPLETE goal (last-write-wins), exactly as
 *     `todo_write` does. The log is the truth, so a resume restores the goal
 *     without a separate store, and the model never pays context for it.
 *  2. **Continuation rides the existing ephemeral-tail channel.** There is no new
 *     core mechanism: the `beforeLLMCall` hook appends one temporary user message
 *     to the request under construction, which is the same request-level tail the
 *     job-finished notice and the stale-plan nag already use (not logged, not in
 *     `opts.messages`, recomputed per request ⇒ at-least-once). Producing it from
 *     the PLUGIN side is deliberate: core would otherwise have to learn what a
 *     goal is in order to hard-code a third producer.
 *  3. **Round admission is the hook's job, not the tool's.** `rounds` counts
 *     continuation runs, so it advances where the continuation prompt is built —
 *     otherwise "how many rounds have run" and "how many times were we asked to
 *     continue" would be two different numbers.
 *
 * The goal is resumable state, not an instruction to keep spending: the loop stops
 * asking once the round budget is spent, and `blocked`/`complete` end it outright.
