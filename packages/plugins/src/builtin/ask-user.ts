 * broker, and renders the answer back as JSON. Whether anyone can answer is the

 * with no human attached (headless `exec`, the QQ channel), and the tool then
 * fails with the same typed error the asker would raise — a defined outcome the
 * model can act on rather than a hang.
 *
 * That absence is deliberately not "the tool is not registered": a model that
 * needs a decision should learn that nobody can give one here, and a tool that
 * simply is not in its list teaches it nothing. The error text says which
 * situation it is in.
