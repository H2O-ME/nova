/**
 * Re-point the tool root, the docs and the skills at `dir`, and keep the live
 * session consistent with the move: the re-roster reloads the AGENTS.md chain
 * and skill index, the `workspace` marker is appended (a surface files a session
 * by the NEWEST marker in its log; log-only, so the model surface is untouched),
 * and a session nobody has spoken to yet is replaced so its first prompt builds
 * a fragment naming the new workspace.
 *
 * That last step is why this is shared code. The fragment is appended ONCE, at
 * session creation, so leaving a just-moved blank session alone would send the
 * OLD cwd and AGENTS.md chain on its first prompt. Only a blank session may be
 * replaced — `isBlankSession` means no user has spoken, so nothing is lost; one
 * with real turns keeps its fragment, which truthfully records where it ran.
 * A session already belonging to `dir` (the resume path) is not re-seeded: its
 * log is a durable artifact the reader chose to open, and replacing it would
 * discard that choice.
 * @param env - the assembled kernel environment.
 * @param dir - the new workspace root.
 * @returns the skills loaded for the new root.
