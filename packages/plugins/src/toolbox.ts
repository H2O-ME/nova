/**
 * The tool and command registries, as container services.
 *
 * This is what a plugin registers *into*, and what the loop, the surfaces and
 * the approval gate read *from* — so it is the busiest seam in the system. It
 * owns only the registry semantics (uniqueness, ownership, live views); what a
 * tool *does* stays in the plugin that registered it.
 *
 * Ownership is read from the registering plugin's own fiber — the `Context` a
 * plugin body receives carries that fiber, so `ctx.fiber.name` IS the plugin's
 * name. It used to be threaded in by a loading adapter, which meant a plugin
 * loaded by any other route registered its tools under `'assembly'`.
