/**
 * `createAgentKernel` — the one assembly point between the kernel and the
 * plugin world.
 *
 * The browser UI, the readline REPL, the bot channel and the headless runners
 * all drive THIS, so no surface can drift from the others. Four steps:
 *
 *  1. open a container root — the whole app's plugin world (`runtime-env`);
 *  2. publish the capability services (approval, llm, jobs, sessions, spill,
 *     compaction, skills) as provider plugins, each replaceable by key;
 *  3. build the tool host on that same root and load the roster — the built-ins
 *     plus one row per `plugins.entries` entry, the row's own `enabled` and tier
 *     deciding whether it starts — then the approval gate, which reads the live
 *     registry and gate (`runtime-roster`);
 *  4. open the first session handle through the `sessions` service.
 *
 * The provider is injected (core defines `ChatProvider`; only the shells build
 * one from config): the same seam that keeps the loop provider-agnostic keeps
 * the assembly surface-agnostic.
 *
 * The surrounding files exist so each step reads alone: `runtime-types`
 * (contracts) — `runtime-env` (container + closures) — `runtime-roster` (what
 * loads) — `runtime-facade` (the object surfaces hold).
