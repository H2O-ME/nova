/**
 * The plugin TREE: how the shipped plugins, the optional packages and the
 * operator's own entries become one ordered list of rows.
 *
 * This module replaces two things that made "add a plugin" a source change:
 *
 *  - the tier/label TABLES keyed by plugin name (`CORE_PLUGINS`,
 *    `ADVANCED_PLUGINS`, `PLUGIN_LABELS`, `enabledByTier`), which meant the host
 *    had to know every plugin by name to draw its row or decide its default;
 *  - the per-name factory `switch` in `extensions.ts`, which meant every new
 *    optional package needed a new `case`.
 *
 * Now a row comes from the plugin itself: its `name` is the id, its `manifest`
 * supplies the operator-facing title/description/tier, and its tier supplies the
 * default enabled state (`core`/`standard` on, `advanced` off). The only list
 * the product still ships is WHICH package specifiers exist — a composition
 * fact, not a per-plugin behaviour branch.
 *
 * ## Identity
 *
 * An entry's `id` is either a built-in plugin's `name` (`bash`, `fs-read`) or a
 * module specifier (`./my-plugin.mjs`, `@nova-agent/plugin-ptc`). Resolution is
 * deliberately ordered: every in-process built-in is placed first, so a spec can
 * never shadow a shipped row by accident; every remaining id is treated as a
 * module spec and resolved by the ONE spec rule (`module-spec.ts`).
 *
 * ## Importing is not activating
 *
 * A spec module is imported even when its row is off, because its manifest is
 * what draws the row. No `apply` runs and no fiber is created for a disabled
 * row, so a disabled plugin starts nothing — the rule the QQ channel violated
 * when the host dialed it from a candidate object it had kept around. A plugin
 * module must therefore stay import-side-effect-free.

/**
 * The optional packages this product ships as part of its own distribution.
 *
 * These three are the product's OWN extension packages (`plugin-*`): kernel-
 * adjacent code that the product builds and lists so an operator can discover
 * and switch on a feature they have not opted into yet. Their specifiers live
 * here because the kernel must be able to name what it ships; a manifest decides
 * whether each is on (`advanced` = off), so adding one is a distribution
 * statement and needs no `case` anywhere in behaviour code.
 *
 * NOT here: the QQ channel package, and deliberately. It is the THIRD-PARTY
 * authoring example (see AGENTS.md §4) — it depends on this package, not the
 * other way round, and its credentials and settings live in its own config row,
 * so an operator who wants a QQ channel writes a row either way. Listing it here
 * would make the kernel name a downstream package: a declared cycle, a gate
 * exception, and a privilege no third-party plugin gets.
 *
 * Order is load order, and it is load-bearing for at least one pair: a PTC-mode
 * SDK projection is generated against a registry that already contains the

 * The tier to draw a row under when its module could NOT be imported.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * Reaching the `catch` above means `import()` failed, and a plugin's manifest
 * lives INSIDE the module that failed — there is no `manifestOf(plugin)` to ask.
 * The row used to be hardcoded `standard`, which is a declaration contradicting
 * the product's own knowledge in two ways at once: it decided whether the row was
 * OFF (it cannot — `standard` is ON by default) and it drew the row in the
 * `standard` group, for an `advanced` package the product knows ships OFF. So the
 * one row this failure path exists to describe was described wrongly, in both of
 * the fields that decide what the operator sees.
 *
 * ## Why this source (option B, chosen over "report every unreadable row")
 *
 * The specifiers in `SHIPPED_PACKAGES` are built by THIS repository and listed
 * here on purpose, so their tier is a fact of the build — statable without the
 * module, exactly as their manifests state it. Every one of them is an extension
 * package, and every extension package ships `advanced` (default off); the
 * fallback is stated rather than listed per-name so this stays ONE list that
 * cannot drift from itself. The conservative alternative (report a failure for
 * every row whose manifest cannot be read) would leave the reported defect in
 * place: a missing shipped package would keep printing a failure line, on every
 * start, for a row the operator never opened.
 *
 * A THIRD-PARTY spec gets `standard` — the same fail-open default core gives a
 * manifest-less plugin (`manifestOf`). That is safe here precisely because it is
 * fail-open in the LOUD direction: `standard` is ON by default, so a third-party
 * row the operator named still reports its load failure. Silencing a real failure
 * would take an id this build claims to ship.
 *
 * The copy is not left to rot: `test/plugin-tree.test.ts` compares this answer
 * with the tier the package itself declares.
 * @param spec - the module specifier that failed to import.
 * @returns the tier to draw the row under, and the default its switch follows.
