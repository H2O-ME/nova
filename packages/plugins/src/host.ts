/**
 * `PluginHost` — the kernel's view of the plugin tree.
 *
 * There is ONE plugin protocol: core's `Plugin`
 * (`{ name, manifest?, Config?, inject?, apply(ctx, config) }`), the same shape
 * the container loads and the same shape a third-party module exports. Lifecycle
 * belongs to `PluginLoader` (core), which reconciles a tree of stable entries.
 *
 * This class is a thin projection: it owns the shared root `Context` and the
 * loader, provides the loader AS a service (so a plugin can add, restart and drop
 * rows itself), and exposes the registries the loop and the surfaces read. It
 * owns no activation logic of its own — an entry that is not in the tree is not
 * loaded, and a disabled entry starts nothing.
