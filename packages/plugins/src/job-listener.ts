/**
 * The `job_update` listener, built once so every path that re-binds it (a new
 * session, a switch) routes by the same rule.
 *
 * The registry is per-PROCESS — a job must outlive the turn that spawned it, and
 * survives a session switch — so "which session is current" has to be resolved
 * at ANNOUNCE time, not at registration time. Two consequences, both handled
 * here rather than by the caller:
 *
 * 1. Resolving per announce is why a listener bound to one session at creation
 *    was wrong: after a switch it would keep publishing into the session the
 *    user left.
 * 2. The job must ALSO belong to the session that is now current. Otherwise a
 *    job started in A announces itself into B the moment the user switches,
 *    and B's transcript grows a row for work it never asked for. A job that is
 *    not current is not lost: its row is rebuilt from `jobSnapshots()` on the
 *    next `ready`, which is the same contract the transcript uses.
 * @param env - the kernel environment (the registry and the sessions provider).
 * @returns the listener to hand to `jobs.setListener`.
