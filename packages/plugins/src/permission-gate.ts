 * (`hooks.ts` says HOW the chains are built; this says WHO decides a call). The
 * distinction became load-bearing when the decision became per session: the gate
 * is the one place that must read `ToolCallScope` and reach the engine of the
 * conversation that issued the call.

/**
 * The gate decides with the PERMISSION ENGINE OF THE SESSION THAT ISSUED THE
 * CALL, reached through `ToolCallScope.sessionId`, and never with a
 * process-global one.
 *
 * That is the whole security property. One kernel runs several conversations at
 * once (a chat peer, the desktop, a resumed tab), so a shared engine let a peer's
 * tier — and a peer's remembered "always allow" grants — decide the desktop's
 * calls. The container's `approval` service is used only when the call belongs to
 * no session at all (an embedder driving the loop directly); a scope naming a
 * session this kernel no longer holds is refused rather than decided under
 * somebody else's tier.
