 * The capability seams — one name per thing the application can replace.
 *
 * The container (`context.ts` / `fiber.ts`) says *how* plugins load; this file
 * says *what they load for*. Every entry is a `ServiceKey` (a provider registers
 * it, consumers declare it in `inject` and read it with `ctx.must(key)`) or an
 * `EventKey` (a lifecycle point others hook into), and each one is a seam an
 * operator can fill from `~/.nova/config.json` without touching source: drop a
 * capability by leaving its provider out, replace one by loading another.
 *
 * The interface next to each key is the contract — deliberately behavioural, not
 * a snapshot of today's implementation: a tool registry can be backed by a
 * sandbox, a compaction service by a cheaper summarizer model, an LLM service by
 * any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. `core` owns these shapes; the provider plugins
 * live where they belong (the `plugins` package for the shipped ones).
 *
 * Two rules keep this list from rotting:
 *  - a key is added only when something already *consumes* it (no speculative
 *    seams), and
 *  - the interface describes what a consumer needs, not what the current
 *    provider happens to have.
