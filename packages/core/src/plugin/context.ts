/**
 * The context — what a plugin body receives. It is the only way a plugin
 * reaches a capability (a *service*, addressed by a typed key and declared
 * up front in `inject`) and the only way it registers one (as an effect, so
 * unloading takes it back automatically).
 *
 * Design notes worth keeping:
 *  - Services are addressed by key, not by property magic: `ctx.must(llm)` is
 *    greppable, typed, and fails with the plugin's own name in the message.
 *  - `inject` is a *requirement* list (see `satisfied()`); optional
 *    capabilities use `ctx.get(...)` instead, which keeps the boot check
 *    meaningful.
 *  - Nothing here knows about agents, tools or terminals. The agent loop is a
 *    plugin like any other; this file is the whole framework.
