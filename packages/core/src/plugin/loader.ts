/**
 * The plugin LOADER — the one owner of plugin-tree lifecycle, and a SERVICE.
 *
 * A running kernel is a TREE of entries. An entry has a stable `id`, a plugin
 * object (or nested rows, when it is a group), raw config, an enabled state, and
 * optionally a private scope for the services it isolates or wraps. The loader is
 * the only component that turns a desired tree into live fibers and back.
 *
 * ## Why this exists instead of the array the host used to keep
 *
 *  - **Identity.** A re-roster (workspace switch, a settings flip, a config
 *    reload) is a DIFF, not a rebuild. An entry whose plugin and config are
 *    unchanged keeps its fiber, so its tools, services and event listeners are
 *    never torn down and re-registered.
 *  - **Disabled means NOT ACTIVATED.** A disabled entry keeps its row (the
 *    management page has to be able to switch it back on) but runs no `apply` and
 *    creates no fiber, so it can start nothing — no socket, no worker, no timer.
 *  - **Resources belong to the fiber.** Everything a plugin creates must be
 *    registered through `ctx.effect()`. The loader therefore does not know what a
 *    plugin owns — it only disposes the fiber, and correct teardown follows from
 *    construction rather than from a host-side cleanup branch per plugin.
 *
 * ## Plugins are not guests
 *
 * `PluginLoader` is provided as the `loader` service, so a plugin reaches the
 * same operations the host does: `create` / `update` / `remove` add, restart and
 * drop other rows at runtime, under its own row. Combined with `isolate` and
 * `intercept` (see `Context.scope`), that is the whole extension model — a plugin
 * can substitute or wrap any service, contribute its own subtree, and take the
 * whole thing down again, without the host exposing a curated API per capability.
 *
 * ## A failing plugin is DATA
 *
 * Import and activation failures are recorded on the entry (`error`) and logged;
 * they are never thrown out of `reconcile`/`create`/`update`. A broken plugin
 * therefore cannot stop the boot, cannot stop another row from loading, and
 * cannot take down the process — the operator sees the failed row and the reason.
 * Only PROGRAMMING errors throw: an unknown id, a duplicate id, a group row with
 * no children. That split is what "one plugin cannot crash the host" means in
 * code.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: module resolution, import-cache invalidation, and the
 * dependency graph a code HMR system needs. This loader reconciles a CONFIG tree
 * (add/update/remove rows); replacing the code of an already-imported module is a
 * different project. See `docs/plugin-architecture-refactor.md`.
