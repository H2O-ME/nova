/**
 * Request assembly for one turn. Finished-job notices are injected AFTER the
 * hook chain on purpose. The beforeLLMCall hooks (notably exec's in-place
 * auto-compact) assume request.messages aliases opts.messages — a shared
 * reference they splice to shrink the outer log. Injecting a clone before them
 * would swallow that splice (the outer array would never shrink and every
 * following turn would re-compact). Here the hook first sees the clean
 * append-only log; the notice then becomes an ephemeral tail on a fresh clone,
 * so it reaches the model but never the log (resume/compact unaffected) and
 * the drain-once registry queue still announces each job exactly once.
 * Delivery is at-least-once though: if this request dies before its assistant
 * reply commits (network exhausted, context-window 400…), the drained notices
 * go back on the queue — announce-zero would silently strand the task.
 *
 * Request-level trims (snip/micro, ch8 layers 2–3) sit BETWEEN the hook chain
 * and the tails: hooks price and splice the true log, then the wire snapshot
 * sheds whole middle groups (snip) and ages old tool bodies into placeholders
 * (micro) on a FRESH array — never an in-place splice of opts.messages, so
 * the auto-compact alias contract and the log projection stay intact. The
 * tails ride on top of the trimmed snapshot, still ephemeral.
 *
 * Stale-plan nudge (ch5 stale-nag): when the model built a todo list but then
 * works tool turn after tool turn without updating it, the plan silently
 * rots. The loop tracks staleness and hands the flag in here; the nudge
 * rides the SAME request-scoped channel as the job notices (ephemeral tail
 * message, never logged, re-armed when the request dies before the reply
 * commits) so it cannot pollute the canonical history or the compaction
 * projection.
