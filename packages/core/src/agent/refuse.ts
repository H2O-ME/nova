/**
 * The results owed by calls that never ran.
 *
 * One invariant ties this file together: the message log keeps a result for every
 * assistant `tool_calls` entry, even when nothing executed. Two things can leave a
 * call without a result — the loop refusing to run it (truncated or unparseable
 * arguments), or the consumer abandoning the generator mid-turn — and both are
 * this module's business. `tools.ts` covers the third case: a call that went
 * through dispatch, including the ones denied or skipped before execution.
 *
 * Why the START event is part of refusing a call: a surface builds its tool row
 * from `tool_call_start`, so a bare `tool_call_result` is drawn nowhere. Emitting
 * only the result made the live stream and a replay disagree about the same run —
 * the browser showed nothing while a reload, which pairs results to calls off the
 * log, showed the failure row.
