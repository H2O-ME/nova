/**
 * The surface-plugin contract — the public API a human-facing end implements.
 *
 * The browser UI, the readline REPL, the bot channel and the headless runners
 * are all implementations of `AgentSurface`. A surface package declares one,
 * the cli loads it from `~/.nova/config.json` (`surfaces`) and asks it
 * `claim(request)` to decide who serves this argv; the winner gets
 * `start(runtime)` with a host-assembled kernel and the surface-affordance
 * command port the host lends it. A third-party surface package depends on
 * nothing above `core`/`plugins` — the same "everything is a plugin" posture
 * tools/commands/hooks already have, now extended to the human-facing end.
 *
 * This is the public contract the `surfaces` capability seam (see
 * `plugin/capabilities.ts`) is shaped around; the registry that loads and
 * resolves these lives in the plugins package (`loadSurfacePlugins`).
 *
 * All types here, no runtime — core stays provider- and host-agnostic, the same
 * way `runAgent` takes a `ChatProvider` interface. The concrete `Kernel` the
 * host passes structurally satisfies `AgentSurfaceKernel`.
