 * "what is this conversation about" and is WRITTEN by the title model
 * (`kernel/title.ts`) — a listing (`session-peek.ts`, the QQ relay) reads it;
 * nothing in the model surface ever does.
 *
 * The marker never joins the model surface — it exists so a session list can
 * show a real label instead of the raw first prompt. The label's own TEXT rule
 * ({@link stripTitleWrappers}) lives here for the same reason: the writer and
 * every reader have to agree on what a label looks like.
