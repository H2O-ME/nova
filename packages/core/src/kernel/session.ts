/**
 * `AgentSession` — the kernel handle a surface drives.
 *
 * This is where the old per-runner assembly contract converges into one
 * owner: the event pump, the durable log ("model-visible means logged" is
 * enforced HERE, not by each shell's bookkeeping), the running-prompt queue
 * (the queue lane every surface renders, generalized into kernel semantics), phase derivation
 * (surfaces stopped guessing "is it thinking" from delta sequences),
 * approvals as request/response events over the broker, compaction with
 * in-place surface splice + anchor reset, auto-compact pre/post gates, and
 * turn-failure classification after log repair.
 *
 * A surface never writes `messages` or the `Session` log itself; it drives
 * the handle and renders the event stream. That is the seam that makes the
 * browser / REPL / bot channels interchangeable consumers of the same kernel.

   * One run, then a run for any queued prompt that still needs one.

   * INVARIANT: a prompt that enqueued because it saw `running === true` always
   * gets a run. `prompt()` decides "queue or start" from `running`
   * (`runController !== undefined`), and it reads that flag only AFTER
   * `await session.append(...)` — a real suspension point. So a prompt can queue
   * while this loop is between runs, and the loop must be able to hand ownership
   * to it. Both defects below came from getting that handoff wrong:
   *
   *  - The dropped trigger ("no reply"). The old loop read
   *    `flushed = this.pending.length`, IMMEDIATELY cleared `pending`, and only
   *    then consulted its continue condition —
   *    `while (flushed > 0 && !closed && !signal.aborted)`. Once the signal was
   *    aborted that condition was false, so entries it had just cleared were
   *    never run: the queue was DESTROYED instead of deferred. A prompt sent
   *    after the user pressed stop was logged and displayed, then silently denied
   *    the run it had queued for (its text did survive in `messages`, so it only
   *    resurfaced if the user happened to send something else later). This loop
   *    never clears here at all (the one clear point is the queue's absorption
   *    when a request reads the entries), it re-reads the LIVE queue after each
   *    run, and at an aborted boundary it adopts a FRESH controller so entries
   *    committed after the stop still get their run.
   *  - The double answer. Clearing only after the whole run meant an interjection
   *    the run had already read and answered stayed queued and earned a SECOND
   *    run: the model was handed a history ending in its own reply to that text
   *    and answered it again (see `countingProvider`).
   *
   * The controller is cleared before the queue is re-read so that a racing
   * `prompt()` either sees `running === false` and starts its own loop, or finds
   * its entry still queued and gets served here. That ordering is belt-and-
   * braces — the two statements are adjacent with no `await` between them — but
   * it keeps the invariant local and readable rather than resting on that fact.
   *
   * `abort()` withdraws leftover triggers deliberately — see the note there.

   *     arrived during the failed attempt. Counting the retry would swallow it.
   *
